            The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.

                Chemical Equations
            </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
           <p> <b>2H2 + O2 = 2H2O</b></p>
           <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H2) </i>and oxygen gas <i>(O2)</i> to form water <i>(H2O)</i>.

            <b>Important Concepts</b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
<p> Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while superscripts represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.

            <b>Conclusion</b>
        </h5>
<p>
    Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
